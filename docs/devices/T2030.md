## Notes

### General
The lamp only contains presumably a standard [SILVERGLANS driver](./ICPSHC24-30-IL44-1.md) with just slightly modified firmware to report a different model.

### Pairing
Factory reset the driver by holding the dedicated recessed reset button for at least 10 seconds (as described in the manual).
Alternatively (or if already installed/mounted) toggle mains power to the lamp 5 times: start with it off, switch it on and then off again every time the light comes on. The fifth time leave it on.
The lamp will start pulsing after factory reset.
